  #  <%= link_to 'New article', new_article_path %> Rails erb evaluated "new_article_path" to "articles/new". And browser sends default "GET" request to server.

  # If you want to link to an action in the same controller, you don't need to specify the :controller option, as Rails will use the current controller by default.
  # >>Check that Link_to results in default GET request. (bcx it does not specify any HTTP action method)
  #     >Ex1: So article_path(article) is converted/processed by erb into "articles/article_id" and browser makes a default GET request to this address.
  #     HTML: <a href="/articles/5">Show</a>
  #     >Ex2: "articles_path" is converted to "/articles". and default request is "GET". Now when rails sees this, routes matches it to "articles#index" controller
  # >>Whereas we explicitly mention request_method = "delete" in case of destroy, whose request url is also "/articles/article_id"
  #     HTML: <a data-confirm="Are you sure?" rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" href="/articles/5">Destroy</a>

  def index
    @articles = Article.all
  end

  # We use Article.find to find the article we're interested in, passing in params[:id] to get the :id parameter from the request.
  # We also use an instance variable (prefixed with @) to hold a reference to the article object.
  # We do this because Rails will pass all "instance variables" to the view
  def show
    @article = Article.find(params[:id])
  end

  # 1. The reason why we added @article = Article.new in the ArticlesController is that otherwise
  # @article would be nil in our view, and calling @article.errors.any? would throw an error.

  # 2. this action/route should only be used to display the form for a new article.
  # By default the FORM-BUILDER sends submit request to the corresponding action(in this 'new'). But we want submit request at new.html.erb to goto
  # create action. This can be done by :url option of form_with. Like "url: articles_path".
  # >>the articles_path helper is passed to the :url option.
  # >>"articles_path" helper tells Rails to point the form to the URI Pattern associated with the articles prefix;
  # >>and the "FORM will (by default) send a POST request" to that route("/articles").
  # >>This is associated with the create action of the current controller, the ArticlesController.

  def edit

  # Notice that inside the create action we use "render" instead of "redirect_to" when save returns false.
  # The render method is used so that the @article object is passed back to the “new” template when it is rendered.
  # This rendering is done within the same request as the form submission, whereas the redirect_to will tell the browser to issue another request.
  def create
    # render plain: params[:article].inspect
    # @article = Article.new(params[:article])  #error: cannot save all parameters at once: strong_parameters
    @article = Article.new(article_params)

    # @article.save
    # redirect_to @article    #CALL to show action?
    if @article.save
      redirect_to @article    #redirect the user to the show action; this is not internal. we told the browser to send new request at specified "redirected path"
